<div class="panel">
<p>We, the G7 Ministers responsible for Climate and Environment, met virtually on 20 -21 May 2021.</p>
<p>As we continue to address the ongoing pandemic, we acknowledge with grave concern that the unprecedented and interdependent crises of climate change and biodiversity loss pose an existential threat to nature, people, prosperity and security. We recognise that some of the key drivers of global biodiversity loss and climate change are the same as those that increase the risk of zoonoses, which can lead to pandemics. We highlight that urgent and concrete action is needed to move towards global sustainability, further mitigate and adapt to climate change, as well as halt and reverse biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. We recognise that climate change and the health of the natural environment are intrinsically linked and will ensure that the actions we take maximise the opportunities to solve these crises in parallel.</p>
<p>We will do this by building back better from the pandemic, and we stress our determination to put climate, biodiversity, and the environment at the heart of our COVID-19 recovery strategies and investments. In doing so, we will transform our economies to promote sustainable development, deliver decent green jobs and build resilience. We will also accelerate the clean energy transition, improve resource efficiency, including by reducing food loss and waste and promoting a circular economic approach, transition to sustainable supply chains and mainstream nature, including biodiversity, and climate into economic decision-making. We will help set the world on a nature positive and climate-resilient pathway to bend the curve of biodiversity loss by 2030 and to keep a limit of 1.5°C temperature rise within reach by making our 2030 ambitions consistent with the aim of achieving net zero emissions as soon as possible and by 2050 at the latest.</P>
<p> We recognise these are global challenges which require urgent and ambitious global action at all levels. We reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism, and will work collectively to implement fully our national and international commitments. In this critical year of action we recognise the need to increase global ambition and enhance collaboration, underpinned by the most ambitious sub-national, national and international action. We call on all countries to join us in action.</p>
<p> The COVID-19 crisis has reinforced the importance of science and evidence in government policies and decision-making. Recent assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the International Resource Panel (IRP), and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) have documented that rapid and far-reaching transformations across all sectors of society and the economy are necessary to tackle climate change, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. Recalling the outcomes of previous G7 meetings on Earth observation systems, we recognise the important role of research and systematic observation to provide information on the state of the planet and support and guide action to address climate change and conserve, protect and restore essential and biodiverse ecosystems. We will ensure our domestic action and international commitments are informed by the best available science and will support others wishing to enhance their evidence-based policy-making processes by sharing our experiences and best practices.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h1 id="Net zero energy">Net zero energy</h1></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We recognise the key contribution of energy efficiency as “the first fuel” to emissions reduction, energy security, economic growth, sustainable development, alleviating energy poverty, and job creation. We therefore note with concern the decline in the global rate of energy efficiency improvements and commit to strengthen our efforts to deliver improvements in buildings, industry and transport. We continue to emphasise the need for stronger international exchanges to learn about best practices in this policy space. We stress the importance of strengthening and coordinating international collaboration in developing policy frameworks for new business models and to ensure the necessary investments in energy efficiency measures in all sectors. We therefore welcome the establishment of the Energy Efficiency Hub, hosted at the International Energy Agency, as a key international forum for global collaboration on energy efficiency. We welcome the Super-Efficient Equipment and Appliance Deployment (SEAD) initiative. We further endorse its goal of doubling the efficiency of four key energy-using products sold globally by 2030: lighting, cooling, refrigeration, and motor systems, and will contribute to that end using the full policy toolkit at our disposal.

We affirm the fundamental role of renewable energy sources. We welcome the rapid growth, decreasing cost and increasing value of renewable energy technologies around the world. We stress the need for their further integration in the systems, and we recognise that renewables are a major driver of economic growth, jobs, and increased access to affordable energy. We recognise that the significant progress made in the development and deployment of renewable energy has been driven by a virtuous circle of technological development, a supportive regulatory and policy environment including innovative market designs, and industry-led cost reductions. We affirm our commitment to supporting the development and deployment of renewable energy globally, particularly for developing countries, as well as accelerating the development and deployment of renewable heating and cooling, where a step change in progress is urgently required. We recognise the importance of promoting clean energy transitions in islands, as well as in remote and rural communities, through innovative renewable energy solutions, fostering self-determination and community ownership of resources.

We recognise the role of energy storage as an enabling technology to support the transformation of the global economy towards a net zero pathway. We commit to drive energy storage technology innovation and accelerate its commercialisation and deployment by supporting the private sector in reducing the cost and increasing the performance of energy storage technologies, through policies and tools supportive of energy storage market adoption, including regulatory frameworks and market structures.

Recognising that coal power generation is the single biggest cause of global temperature increases, we commit now to rapidly scale-up technologies and policies that further accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity and to an overwhelmingly decarbonised power system in the 2030s, consistent with our 2030 NDCs and net zero commitments. In doing so, we reaffirm the importance of national energy security and resilience and underscore the importance of providing support for affected workers, regions and communities. We welcome with appreciation the work of the Energy Transition Council in supporting the new economic opportunities and sustained quality job creation offered by a transition to clean energy in developing countries. We commit to exploring further ways that we can accelerate global progress towards net zero power, including leading by example as the G7, and working with collaborative initiatives and institutions. We note that several G7 members participate in the Powering Past Coal Alliance. We will convene by COP26 to lay the groundwork for further joint action by G7 members.

In line with Article 2.1.c of the Paris Agreement, we commit to aligning official international financing with the global achievement of net zero GHG emissions no later than 2050 and deep emissions reductions in the 2020s. We commit to promoting the increased international flow of public and private capital toward Paris Agreement-aligned investments and away from high-carbon power generation to support the clean energy transition in developing countries. In this context, we will phase out new direct government support for carbon intensive international fossil fuel energy, except in limited circumstances at the discretion of each country, in a manner that is consistent with an ambitious, clearly defined pathway towards climate neutrality in order to keep 1.5°C within reach, in line with the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement and best available science. Consistent with this overall approach and recognising that continued global investment in unabated coal power generation is incompatible with keeping 1.5°C within reach, we stress that international investments in unabated coal must stop now and commit to take concrete steps towards an absolute end to new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation by the end of 2021, including through Official Development Assistance, export finance, investment, and financial and trade promotion support. We commit to reviewing our official trade, export and development finance policies towards these objectives. We further call on other major economies to adopt these commitments. We welcome the support provided and mobilised by DFIs and multilateral funds, including the GCF, to support the energy transition. In particular, we note the recent Climate Investment Funds board decision to launch new sector specific funds, including those to accelerate coal transitions, and support renewable energy deployment in emerging economies.

We reaffirm the need to take into account the imperative of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities, as reflected in the Paris Agreement. Recalling the SDGs, we commit ourselves to a people-centred transition, that will work to create decent employment in the low carbon economy while making energy more accessible, affordable, and cleaner for all communities. We support reskilling workers across industries and communities and developing the industries of the future, as the clean energy transition continues to gather momentum. We welcome the substantial economic opportunities inherent in a people-centred transition, including alleviating energy poverty for people and communities, removing barriers to employment, especially for marginalised populations, which will in turn lead to substantial and equitable economic growth and prosperity for all.

We recognise that inefficient fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, reduce energy security, impede investment in clean energy sources, and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change. We reaffirm our commitment to the elimination of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 and encourage all countries to adopt this commitment. We encourage greater international action to meet this commitment and we support calls for greater transparency.

We recognise the importance of ambitious and urgent action to reduce emissions and leakage of methane (fossil and biogenic) from the energy sector, as well as waste and agricultural sectors, and of other potent warming substances, such as black carbon, in order to slow global warming. This will require improved measurement and reporting to better locate and quantify these emissions.

We recognise the importance of maintaining energy security as we transform our energy systems and the need for energy markets that are open, flexible, transparent, competitive, stable, sustainable, reliable and resilient. We reaffirm the need for investment to ensure energy supply and demand remain balanced throughout energy transitions, recognising the need for energy demand to be met by sources that align with our Paris Agreement and net zero objectives. We commit to developing strategies and actions that enhance our focus on the security of innovative, clean, safe, and sustainable energy technologies. This includes resilience in the face of cyber security threats, the system integration of variable renewable energy, energy storage, flexible power plants, hydrogen, as well as demand side management, smart grids, and related infrastructure including the accommodation of sustainable biofuels and hydrogen. We recognise the important role of electricity interconnection in market integration, flexibility and promoting decarbonisation, alongside supporting security of supply and system security. We recognise that natural gas may still be needed during the clean energy transition on a time-limited basis and we will work to abate related emissions towards overwhelmingly decarbonised power systems in the 2030s. We also note the importance of ensuring secure, safe and sustainable clean energy supply chains, including with regards to critical minerals and critical renewables components.

We affirm that access to secure affordable, reliable, sustainable, clean and modern energy is a key enabler of the SDGs. We welcome progress made to increase energy access and eradicate energy poverty worldwide, while noting that the world remains off-track to meet our SDG for access to energy. We note the essential role of gender equality in achieving sustainable energy access and welcome synergies with the work of the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council. We stress the importance of achieving universal, equitable and sustainable access in driving forward a global and inclusive clean energy transition that addresses the disproportionate impact of energy poverty on vulnerable and marginalised populations, both in developing countries and in more mature economies. We welcome the UN commitment to address progress on SDG7 within the High-Level Energy Dialogue.

Those countries that opt to use it reaffirmed the role of nuclear energy in their energy mix. Those countries recognise its potential to provide affordable low carbon energy and contribute to the security of energy supply as a baseload energy source.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h1 id="Net zero mobility">net zero mobility</h1></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We stress the urgent need to promote sustainable mobility and reduce GHG emissions from the transport sector to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We recognise that this will require dramatically increasing the pace of the global decarbonisation of the road transport sector throughout the 2020s and beyond, consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and our respective 2030 NDCs and net zero commitments. In this regard, and as part of this effort, we welcome and support the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council and will work with other global partners to accelerate the deployment of zero emission vehicles for passengers and freight, including exploring ways to support developing countries in making the transition. We further recognise the commitments of some states to the target of sales of passenger cars being zero emission by 2040 or earlier. Furthermore, we also need to promote decarbonising the entire life cycle of vehicles. We commit to support transitioning our industrial bases and providing ambitious investment to research, further develop, and scale up the technologies needed to support a rapidly growing global market for sustainable mobility. We will intensify our efforts in enhancing the offer of more sustainable transport modes in urban and rural areas, including public transport, shared mobility, cycling and walking, and supporting inter-modal transport with investment in rail and waterborne infrastructure.

We further recognise the urgent need for effective efforts to reduce emissions from the international aviation and maritime sectors to put both sectors on a pathway of emissions reduction consistent with the mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement. We commit to supporting the development and adoption of ambitious mid- and long-term measures at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and to building a global consensus on strengthening the levels of ambition in the initial IMO strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships in the context of its forthcoming revision, with the aim of contributing to the Paris Agreement temperature goal. We will also support the development and adoption of an ambitious long-term global goal at the International Civil Aviation Organization in line with our vision for decarbonising the aviation sector.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h1 id="Net zero innovation">Net zero innovation</h1></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We recognise clean energy innovation as a driver of sustainable and inclusive growth to create jobs, an enabler of a resilient economic recovery. We also recognise the need to accelerate innovation this decade to meet our net zero goal by 2050 or sooner. This includes scaling up demonstrations and the early deployment of zero and negative carbon technologies while ensuring negative impacts on the environment and human wellbeing are avoided. This must be enabled by mechanisms and clear signals, including an increased focus on ESG (environmental, social and governance) performance, that incentivise private sector investment to fast-track innovations to the market. To accelerate the pace of industry decarbonisation, we commit to launch the G7 Industrial Decarbonisation Agenda to complement and support the activities of existing key initiatives and amplify ambition, while plugging critical gaps in the landscape wherever they exist.

For the G7, we commit to increasing clean energy innovation investments to a level in line with our net zero ambition. We support the launch of a second phase of Mission Innovation as a global platform to strengthen international cooperation that will continually promote increased clean energy innovation ambition and concrete actions for clean energy technical innovation. We support the commencement of Clean Energy Ministerial’s third phase as a global platform to share experience, raise ambition, and implement cooperative action for clean energy deployment, including innovative policy, regulatory and market measures. We encourage closer alignment between Mission Innovation and the Clean Energy Ministerial to better coordinate efforts from innovation all the way through to the deployment of clean and sustainable energy technologies including through energy efficiency and from renewable energy sources. We will design appropriate pull mechanisms to accelerate the innovation and scaling up of clean energy and net zero technologies across G7 members and to support the green transition in developing countries. We also acknowledge that the successful deployment of clean energy technologies requires further investment in a skilled, technologically advanced and diverse workforce.

Innovation that supports net zero industries can help existing sectors through the transition, as well as creating additional value with the birth of new industries. We will work together in the lead up to COP26, building on existing initiatives to coordinate action on standards and public procurement in order to create globally competitive markets for green industrial products. In parallel, we will also work to reduce emissions from key industrial processes through enhanced energy efficiency, the development of circular economy and resource efficiency principles, electrification, comprehensive industrial heat utilisation and reduced waste in industry, fuel switching and carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS). We recognise the importance of early action to decarbonise hard-to-abate industrial sectors such as iron and steel, cement, chemicals, and petrochemicals, to ensure that emissions across the entire economy reach net zero by 2050. For these hard to abate sectors to achieve this, we commit to targeting greater levels of innovation funding to lower the costs of industrial decarbonisation technologies, including the use of hydrogen, electrification, sustainable biomass, CCUS and synthetic fuels (including ammonia and fuels made from hydrogen). Acknowledging that achieving net zero industry will require enhanced global efforts, we will support low and middle-income countries through financial and technical cooperation, as well as in multilateral fora. We will work together to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry, and welcome the development of the new Industrial Decarbonisation Innovation Mission and the launch of the Clean Energy Ministerial’s Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative, while supporting ongoing activities in the Leadership Group for Industry Transition.

We recognise the importance of renewable and low carbon hydrogen on the pathway to net zero. We will step up efforts to advance commercial scale hydrogen from low carbon and renewable sources across our economies, including support for fuel cell deployment globally. This will help realise the development of a future international hydrogen market that creates new jobs for current and future workers in the energy sector.

While the focus must remain on protecting and expanding our natural carbon sinks, we recognise that negative emissions technologies, such as Direct Air Capture, can also play a role in reaching net zero GHG emissions. Negative emissions will be required to offset residual emissions in sectors that are difficult to decarbonise completely. Technical solutions such as CCUS, and carbon recycling where appropriate, will also be important for some countries in meeting our goal of a net zero economy.</p></div>
